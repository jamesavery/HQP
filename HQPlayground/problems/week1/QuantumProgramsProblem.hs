{-| Exercise: Quantum Programs.

This exercise accompanies the "Quantum Programs" problem sheet
(Exercise 1, 2, 3, 4). It builds directly on the `QOp` grammar from the
lecture:

  data QOp = I | X | SX | Y | Z | H | R QOp RealT
          | C QOp | SWAP
          | Tensor QOp QOp | DirectSum QOp QOp | Compose QOp QOp

A "quantum program" (a sequence of unitary Steps and Measurements) is
just represented directly as a Haskell `do` block that chains `apply`
and `measureProjection` calls in order -- exactly like the No-Cloning
example you were given. There is no need for a separate Program type;
running `main` *is* running the program.

1. Complete `bellProgram`, which runs a 2-step "program" (H on qubit 0,
   then CNOT) starting from |00>, using `Compose` to build a single QOp
   for the whole 2-qubit circuit before calling `evalOp`/`apply` once.

2. Complete `runWithMidCircuitMeasurement`, a 3-step "program": prepare
   the Bell state, measure qubit 0, then measure qubit 1, printing the
   state after each step (paper Exercise 3).

3. Complete `directSumCNOT`, building CNOT using `DirectSum I X` instead
   of `C X`, and check in `main` that it agrees with `C X` on all four
   computational basis states (paper Exercise 4b).

4. Complete `myUnitary`, an arbitrary single-qubit unitary built as a
   `Compose` chain of `H` and `R Z theta` Ops (recall H conjugates
   Z-rotations into X-rotations), and check what it does to |0> (paper
   Exercise 5a).

    -- TODO (stretch, paper Exercise 5): using only H, R Z theta (for any
    -- theta) and C X, build (as a single Op via Tensor/Compose/C) a
    -- 3-qubit circuit that prepares the GHZ state
    -- 1/sqrt(2) (|000> + |111>) from |000>, and check it with showState.
