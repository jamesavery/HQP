{-| Exercise: Single qubits -- normalization, change of basis, and global
phase invariance.

This exercise accompanies the "Qubits" problem sheet (Exercise 1, 2, 4).
Consult the document "QPP - What it does" if you get lost in code space :-)

1. Complete `normSquared`, which should compute <psi|psi> for a 1-qubit
   state. Use it to check which of the states in `main` are normalized.

2. Complete `basisChange`, which takes a 1-qubit state |psi> and returns
   its coordinates (b0, b1) in the {|+>, |-> } basis, i.e. such that
   |psi> = b0|+> + b1|-> . Build |+>, |-> using the Hadamard operator H
   applied to |0>, |1> (do not hard-code them by hand), then use `inner`
   to project.

3. Complete `applyGlobalPhase`, which multiplies a state by e^{i*alpha}
   for a real angle alpha, using (.*).

4. In `main`, use `applyGlobalPhase` to build psi' = e^{i*alpha} psi for
   some alpha of your choosing, and show numerically (via
   `measureProjection` and `inner`) that psi and psi' give identical
   measurement probabilities in the computational basis. This is the
   computational counterpart of paper Exercise 4 (global phase is
   unobservable).
