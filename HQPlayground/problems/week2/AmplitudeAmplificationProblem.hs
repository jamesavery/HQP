{-| Exercise: the Output Problem and Amplitude Amplification.

This exercise accompanies the "The Output Problem and Amplitude
Amplification" problem sheet (Exercise 2, 3, 4). We build a full Grover
search for N=4 (2 qubits, 1 marked item |11>), and check the amplified
success probability against the sin^2((2k+1) theta) formula you derived
on paper.

Recipe for N=4 with the marked item |11>:
  * The "oracle" phase-flips |11> and leaves everything else alone. This
    is exactly `C Z` (control qubit 1, target qubit 2): when qubit 1 = 1
    it applies Z to qubit 2, which only flips the sign of the |1>
    component, i.e. exactly the |11> branch.
  * The "diffusion" operator reflects about the uniform superposition:
    D = H^{ox2} (2|00><00| - I) H^{ox2}, and (2|00><00| - I) itself can
    be built as (X^{ox2}) (C Z) (X^{ox2}) (flip everything, phase-flip
    |11>, flip back -- which phase-flips everything EXCEPT |00>, i.e.
    exactly 2|00><00| - I up to an overall sign you should track).
