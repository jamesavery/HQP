{-| Exercise: Measurement.

--         TODO TM : Brug probilistiske målinger !!! 


This exercise accompanies the "Measurement" problem sheet
(Exercise 1, 2, 4).

1. Complete `prob`, computing the probability of a given measurement
   outcome as <psi| P |psi> for a (normalized) state psi and a projector
   P built with `measureProjection`.

2. In `main`, reproduce paper Exercise 1+2: measure
   psi = sqrt(1/5)|0> + sqrt(4/5)|1> both in the computational basis and
   in the {|+>,|->} basis (apply H first, then measure computationally),
   and print all four probabilities.

3. Complete `postMeasurementState`, which applies a projector and then
   *normalizes* the result -- i.e. the actual physical post-measurement
   state (not the unnormalized "branch amplitude" used for probability
   computations).

4. In `main`, reproduce the entangled-state partial-measurement analysis
   from paper Exercise 4, but for the state
     phi = 1/2 (|00> + |01> + |10> - |11>)
   Measure qubit 0 in the computational basis; for each outcome, print
   the (normalized) post-measurement 2-qubit state, and comment (as a
   putStrLn) on whether qubit 1 ends up in a definite classical value or
   in a superposition.

5. Complete `biasedCoin`, preparing
     psi(p) = sqrt(p)|0> + sqrt(1-p)|1>
   for p in [0,1], and check numerically that measuring it in the
   computational basis gives P(0) = p (paper Exercise 5).
