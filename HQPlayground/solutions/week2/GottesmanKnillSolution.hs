{-| Exercise: Classical Simulability and the Limits of Quantum Advantage.

This exercise accompanies the "Classical Simulability and the Limits of
Quantum Advantage" problem sheet (Exercise 1, 2, 3).

Key trick used throughout: instead of needing a general "dagger"
operator, note that H, X, Y, Z, and CNOT (= C X) are all self-inverse,
and R Op theta is inverted by R Op (-theta). So wherever you'd
conceptually write U^dagger, you can write it out explicitly using this
fact -- no separate `dagger` function required.

1. Complete `conjugate`, which computes (informally) "U P U^dagger
   applied to psi" by applying U^dagger, then P, then U to a test state
   -- and use it to verify a couple of the Clifford conjugation
   identities from paper Exercise 1 by comparing against the *claimed*
   conjugated Pauli, using your `sameState` helper from the Pauli/Bloch
   exercise sheet (feel free to copy it in here).

2. Complete `bellViaConjugation`, which tracks a Bell-state preparation
   by only ever applying single-qubit conjugation rules on paper/in
   comments (paper Exercise 2) -- then, separately, `bellViaStatevector`
   actually runs the circuit on the full state vector so you can sanity
   check your by-hand stabilizer bookkeeping against the ground truth.

3. Complete `checkTBreaksPauli`, which computes T X T^dagger (using the
   T = R Z (pi/4) trick above) applied to test states, and checks
   whether the result matches ANY of I, X, Y, Z (up to phase) applied to
   those same test states -- demonstrating that T's conjugation action
   is not a Pauli operator (paper Exercise 3).

4. Complete `sizeComparison`, a plain (non-quantum) Haskell function
   printing, for a range of n, the size 2^n of a full amplitude vector
   versus the size n*n of an n-qubit stabilizer tableau -- a simple,
   very concrete way to see why Clifford circuits are cheap to simulate
   classically (paper Exercise 2c / 4a).
