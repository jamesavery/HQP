{-| Exercise: the Quantum Fourier Transform.

This exercise accompanies the "Efficient Quantum Algorithms and the QFT"
problem sheet (Exercise 1, 3, 4).

We build QFT_2 (on 2 qubits) fully worked out below as a warm-up (compare
it against your by-hand matrix from paper Exercise 1b using printS), and
leave QFT_3 (3 qubits) for you to complete.

Recall the standard circuit: for qubit k (1-indexed from the top), apply
H, then a controlled phase rotation R_j = diag(1, e^{2 pi i / 2^j}) from
every qubit below it, with j increasing by 1 each time; finally reverse
the qubit order with SWAPs.

-- | Controlled phase rotation R_j = diag(1, e^{2 pi i / 2^j}), as an Op.
-- Note e^{i*phi} = cos(phi) + i sin(phi); since R Z is defined as a
-- rotation about the Z axis it will pick up a physically irrelevant
-- *global* phase relative to R_j -- for a *controlled* R Z this global
-- phase becomes a genuine relative phase on the |1>-controlled branch,
-- which is exactly the R_j behaviour we want. TODO: double check this
-- against the matrix you derived in the QFT paper exercise, and adjust
-- the angle formula below if there's a factor of 2 discrepancy (recall
-- from the Pauli/Bloch exercises how R Z theta relates to a Z-phase
-- gate diag(1, e^{i theta})).
cphase :: Int -> Op
cphase j = C (R Z (2 * pi / (2 ^ j)))  -- TODO: verify/fix the angle

qft2 :: Op
qft2 =
    Compose (Tensor H I)          -- H on qubit 1
    (Compose (cphase 2)           -- controlled-R_2 from qubit 2 onto qubit 1
             (Compose (Tensor I H) -- H on qubit 2
                       SWAP))      -- reverse qubit order
    -- TODO: check this Compose order matches the library's convention
    -- (does `Compose a b` mean "apply a then b", or "apply b then a"?)
    -- Test it against your hand-derived 4x4 matrix from the paper
    -- exercise by applying it to each of |00>,|01>,|10>,|11>.

-- | QFT on 3 qubits -- your turn!
qft3 :: Op
qft3 = I -- TODO: generalize the qft2 pattern: H + controlled phases +
         -- final SWAPs to reverse all 3 qubits. You will need cphase 2
         -- AND cphase 3 at different points in the circuit.
